### System Features based on Databases

>Our Assets Database System will be throughly structured and strictly based 
>on the membership a particular user has, unless they are administrators of course.

Databases will provide the user with the following features:
1. Data Presentation.
* We will be presenting charts featuring assets on different aspects (i.e Most used, most bought, etc)
* Data presentation will be part of every user in the system so that we may present how many assets they have,
how many they have used, even how long they've been a member.

2. Multi-user access control.
* Users will be able to modify certain aspects of an asset, based of course on the agreement terms made between 
the user and the VRAssets Company.
* Users will be able to organize their aspects in whatever category they prefer, which in term means the database
assigned for such purpose will be as flexible as they come.

3. Downloading Assets.
* Users, based again on their membership and terms; will be able to download certain assets, meaning the
database will also host links directly to the download source of such asset.
