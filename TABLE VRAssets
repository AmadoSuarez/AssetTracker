### Table Asset
---
| **Field/Attribute** | idVRAssets | Asset_name | Asset_size | Asset_quality |
| --------             | -------- |   -------- |   -------- |     -------- |
| **Datatype** |           INT | VAR CHAR (45) | VAR CHAR (45) | VAR CHAR (45) |
| **Flagtype** | PK, NN, UQ | NN |        N/D |            N/D |

*This table version was created only to have a clear understanding about:*
  > Field/Attributes,
  > Datatypes of Fields and 
  > Flagtype of Fields.
  
**Figure 1.2 Definition**

•	This is the database table for VR Assets. **Assets** is known as the *Entity* or *table name*.

•	**Fields** are the attributes pertaining to an Entity. Fields/Attributes are placed on the zero row of a table and the values pertaining to such field/attribute are below them forming a column.

•	Column 1 or idVRAssets is (*as defined on Figure 1.1*) the column reserved for the ID field. The id field will always (or more likely) be referred as a *primary key*, or *unique key* of a table and *not null* (**NN**), or sometimes all of the above. as noted on the *Flagtype* row. ***idVRAssets*** is defined to be of Int type, know why? Yes, inputs can only be of type integer.

•	Column 2 or Asset_name, is the column reserved for the particular name of an Asset but, what about other assets with the same name? Ahh great question! 
* The answer is that none of the tablets or the schema itself is a final draft yet.
* These tables and definitions are only to have a broad understanding of what a final version of the schema will be.
* In conclusion, this is some sort of documentation to make path into the understanding of how databases work as explained briefly in the introduction of this documentation.
