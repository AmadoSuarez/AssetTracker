# 1.    Introduction

## 1.1    Purpose 

AssetTracker is a marketplace for virtual reality assets. This platform will allow producers to upload their assets and consumers to access and download them. The platform is subscription based and consumers will have a tiered subscription model. This platform will have administrators that will have access to statistics and data about the whole system and its users.

## 1.2    Document Conventions

This project, as discussed with the client, will be developed with agile principles and frequent cyclical iterations with the client will be needed where the design or the focus at that particular stage might be re-determined.

**Some definitions:**

**Consumers**: Clients who will pay a subscription to be allowed to download and use the assets available in the marketplace.

**Producers**: Freelancers affiliated to the platform which create the assets and make them available to the consumers.

## 1.3    Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

This document is intended to be read by our developers, the project manager, testers, documentation writers, and the client.

## 1.4    Product Scope

AssetTracker is a great tool to convert a tedious operation into a fully functioning marketplace. It facilitates the process of adding producers and keep track of their sales. Producers (and consumers) can have their own profile and collection page with variety of products. Administrators can easily monitor the overall operation.

# 2.    Overall Description

## 2.1    Product Perspective

AssetTracker is a Virtual Reality Assets marketplace. This project allows viewing various products available, enables registered users to purchase desired products instantly.

This project provides an easy access to Administrators to keep track of all activities inside the whole system. 

## 2.2    Product Functions

AssetTracker is a marketplace for Virtual Reality assets. Instead of designing all of your assets yourself, this platform allows you to buy/lease assets from creators around the country.

The marketplace will allow producers to register, upload, and display their assets into the platform. They will also be able to monitor statistics about their own assets. They also will be able to monitor their royalty earnings from the use of their assets.



Consumers will be able to register under a tiered subscription and download assets as they please as long as it is allow under their particular subscription.



Administrators will be able to manage both consumer and producers accounts, watch the performance of all users and assets, and manage payments.

## 2.3    User Classes and Characteristics

This system has three type of users: producers, consumers, and administrators. Administrators need advance access to the system and can only be created by a super-administrator. However, all three type of users are critical to the well being of the business. 

Producers who will register, upload, and display their assets into the platform. They will also be able to monitor statistics about their own assets. They also will be able to monitor their royalty earnings from the use of their assets.

Consumers will be able to register under a tiered subscription and download assets as they please as long as it is allow under their particular subscription.

Administrators will be able to manage both consumer and producers accounts, watch the performance of all users and assets, and manage payments.

## 2.4    Operating Environment

This project will be launched as a containerized web application hosted in a cloud platform. Docker will be used for the containerization part and Heroku as the cloud platform.

Our Rails deployment option is Heroku, which is a hosted platform built specifically for deploying Rails and other web applications. Heroku makes deploying Rails applications ridiculously easy—as long as your source code is under version control with Git. Heroku’s free tier is more than sufficient for this project. Heroku uses the PostgreSQL database,  which means that we need to add the pg gem in the production environment to allow Rails to talk to Postgres.




## 2.5    Design and Implementation Constraints

The application will be build in Ruby on Rails and Stripe will be used to process the payments, and it will use a Postgres database. Bootstrap and other front-end frameworks might be used. The team will develop the software following Agile principles.

Rails follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which enforces a separation between the data in the application (such as user information) and the code used to display it, which is a common way of structuring a graphical user interface (GUI). When interacting with a Rails application, a browser sends a request, which is received by a webserver and passed on to a Rails controller, which is in charge of what to do next. In some cases, the controller will immediately render a view, which is a template that gets converted to HTML and sent back to the browser. More commonly for dynamic sites, the controller interacts with a model, which is a Ruby object that represents an element of the site (such as a user) and is in charge of communicating with the database. After invoking the model, the controller then renders the view and returns the complete web page to the browser as HTML. 
First we create a data model for the users, which is a representation of the structures needed by our application. Users of our AssetTracker app will have a unique identifier called id (of type integer), a publicly viewable name (of type string),  an email address (also of type string) that will double as a unique username, as well as a type of user (admin or regular user) (also of type string). 
The data model for the assets  has only an id and a type field for the  VR Asset (of type object).  There’s an additional complication, though: we want to associate each asset with a particular user.We’ll accomplish this by recording the user_id of the owner of the  vr asset.





A post-delivery service agreement with the client is on the table but has not been determined yet.

## 2.6    User Documentation

A user manual for all users will be delivered at the final stage in the form of a help page or subdomain within the application.

## 2.7    Assumptions and Dependencies

<List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).>



This projects assumes that the assets will be able to be stored as BLOBS in the Postgres database. If this is not possible, we might have to use Amazon S3 or other solutions to store the assets. This could cause a significant delay in the delivery of the project.

This project assumes that the administrators will be the ones setting subscription prices.

This project assumes the client will provide us with all of the metrics that he would like being monitored in the system and agrees that some metrics might not be possible to track or could cause significant delays and/or affect the budget.

This project also assumes single level administrators without  different privilege levels among them.

# 3.    External Interface Requirements

## 3.1    User Interfaces

<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.>

## 3.2    Hardware Interfaces

<Describe the logical and physical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the hardware components of the system. This may include the supported device types, the nature of the data and control interactions between the software and the hardware, and communication protocols to be used.>

## 3.3    Software Interfaces

<Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.>

## 3.4    Communications Interfaces

<Describe the requirements associated with any communications functions required by this product, including e-mail, web browser, network server communications protocols, electronic forms, and so on. Define any pertinent message formatting. Identify any communication standards that will be used, such as FTP or HTTP. Specify any communication security or encryption issues, data transfer rates, and synchronization mechanisms.>



# 4.    System Features

<This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.>

## 4.1    System Feature 1

<Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few words.>

4.1.1      Description and Priority

<Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).>

4.1.2      Stimulus/Response Sequences

<List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.>

4.1.3      Functional Requirements

<Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.>

 

<Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.>


4.1.4   Pay User 
          A user will have a subscription and will be able to upload assets. Their asset will be revised then published. 
          The user will get paid depending on how many downloads the asset obtains. If the asset is very popular, the proggrammer will get a higher pay.

4.1.5    Publish Assets

        To upload assets the User will need to have a subscription  in order to publish as asset. 
        After the user has been authenticated the asset will be scanned that it dont contain malicious software. 

        1- Create an instance of the Aws::S3::Resource class.

        2-Provide a bucket name and an object key by calling the #bucket[] and the #object[] methods of your Aws::S3::Resource class instance.
        Generate a presigned URL by creating an instance of the URI class, and use it to parse the .presigned_url method of your Aws::S3::Resource class instance. 
        You must specify :put as an argument to .presigned_url, and you must specify PUT to Net::HTTP::Session#send_request if you want to upload an object.

        3-Anyone with the presigned URL can upload an object.

        The upload creates an object or replaces any existing object with the same key that is specified in the presigned URL.


        The actual object will be stored separately storage  from the databse, only the url will be stored in the database. 
        When a user tries to download the asset it will authenticate the sebscription and then either allow or block the user from getting the asset.
        
        
4.1.6   Download An Asset 

            The user must be looged in with a valid subscription. A search asset will be provided. If the user finds an asset that wish to download then he can click the download button.
            The asset link will be retrieved from the AWS #bucket[] and then then get the actual object from the storage. The object download count will be increased by 1 for each time it gets downloaded.

# 5.    Other Nonfunctional Requirements

## 5.1    Performance Requirements

<If there are performance requirements for the product under various circumstances, state them here and explain their rationale, to help the developers understand the intent and make suitable design choices. Specify the timing relationships for real time systems. Make such requirements as specific as possible. You may need to state performance requirements for individual functional requirements or features.>

## 5.2    Safety Requirements

<Specify those requirements that are concerned with possible loss, damage, or harm that could result from the use of the product. Define any safeguards or actions that must be taken, as well as actions that must be prevented.

Some to consider are: adaptability, availability, correctness, flexibility, interoperability, maintainability, portability, reliability, reusability, robustness, testability, and usability. Write these to be specific, quantitative, and verifiable when possible. At the least, clarify the relative preferences for various attributes, such as ease of use over ease of learning.>

## 5.5    Business Rules

<List any operating principles about the product, such as which individuals or roles can perform which functions under specific circumstances. These are not functional requirements in themselves, but they may imply certain functional requirements to enforce the rules.>

# 6.    Other Requirements

<Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections that are pertinent to the project.>

Appendix A: Glossary

<Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to a single project in each SRS.>

Appendix B: Analysis Models

<Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams.>

Appendix C: To Be Determined List
